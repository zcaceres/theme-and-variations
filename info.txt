Here's how Wikipedia explains Theme and Variations:

 "Court dances were long; the tunes which accompanied them were short. Their repetition became intolerably wearisome,
 and inevitably led the player to indulge in extempore variation and ornament"

 Theme and Variations generates a 4-bar musical theme using random integers from Numpy.
 It then passes this theme through transformations like modulation, reversal, and
 other techniques traditionally in theme and variations music.

 It places a MIDI file of your new composition in the project directory, ready for listening.

 Enjoy!
